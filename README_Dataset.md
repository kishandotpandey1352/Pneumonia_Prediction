# Pneumonia_Prediction
To identify if a person is having Pneumonia or not based on the X-Ray images of people, This is an example of Deep Learning in Medical Field.

I will try to use Transfer-Learning techniques or State of the Art algorithm to train my Image dataset. Doing this will not require me to create the model separately. I will use one of the best already prepared model(VGG16) for prediction.

The other Transfer Learning Techniques for modelling are.Available models
Models for image classification with weights trained on ImageNet:

    Xception
    VGG16 (USING HERE IN THIS PROJECT)
    VGG19			-		
    ResNet, ResNetV2
    InceptionV3
    InceptionResNetV2
    MobileNet
    MobileNetV2
    DenseNet
    NASNet

STEPS:
1)Understand the Problem
2)Understand the dataset
3)Understand the Transfer Lerning Techniques and their uses
4)Import libraries and modules, Set the paths for training and Testing
5)Initialise the model
6)Increase the dataset ny Image Gennerator
7)Fit the Transfer Learning technique over your Dataset
8)Plot the Accuracy over training and Test dataset
9)Save the model


Note:The dataset "Pneumonia Dataset" can be downloaded from kaggle. Since it is huge(>25 MB), cannot be uploaded to Github. Link
